# Gas-Detection-System
This repository contains an Arduino‑based fire and gas detection system that uses an MQ‑2 gas sensor and a flame sensor to monitor the environment and alert users to hazardous conditions in real time. The project drives a buzzer and a 16x2 I2C LCD to provide audible and visual warnings whenever gas concentration or flame intensity crosses predefined safety thresholds.
